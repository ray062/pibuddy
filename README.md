This project is to make a pi-like (Resberry Pi, Orange Pi) mini PC like a mini server for travelers. The idea is when it's startup, it detects automatically the best way to make possible connections from client. Then, if possible and necessary, it starts a web server to make configurations, start, stop services etc..
